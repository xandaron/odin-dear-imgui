// ImTextureRef = higher-level identifier for a texture. Store a ImTextureID _or_ a ImTextureData*.
// The identifier is valid even before the texture has been uploaded to the GPU/graphics system.
// This is what gets passed to functions such as `ImGui::Image()`, `ImDrawList::AddImage()`.
// This is what gets stored in draw commands (`ImDrawCmd`) to identify a texture during rendering.
// - When a texture is created by user code (e.g. custom images), we directly store the low-level ImTextureID.
//   Because of this, when displaying your own texture you are likely to ever only manage ImTextureID values on your side.
// - When a texture is created by the backend, we stores a ImTextureData* which becomes an indirection
//   to extract the ImTextureID value during rendering, after texture upload has happened.
// - To create a ImTextureRef from a ImTextureData you can use ImTextureData::GetTexRef().
//   We intentionally do not provide an ImTextureRef constructor for this: we don't expect this
//   to be frequently useful to the end-user, and it would be erroneously called by many legacy code.
// - If you want to bind the current atlas when using custom rectangle, you can use io.Fonts->TexRef.
// - Binding generators for languages such as C (which don't have constructors), should provide a helper, e.g.
//      inline ImTextureRef ImTextureRefFromID(ImTextureID tex_id) { ImTextureRef tex_ref = { ._TexData = NULL, .TexID = tex_id }; return tex_ref; }
// In 1.92 we changed most drawing functions using ImTextureID to use ImTextureRef.
// We intentionally do not provide an implicit ImTextureRef -> ImTextureID cast operator because it is technically lossy to convert ImTextureRef to ImTextureID before rendering.

}

// Flags for ImGui::BeginChild()
// (Legacy: bit 0 must always correspond to ImGuiChildFlags_Borders to be backward compatible with old API using 'bool border = false'.)
// About using AutoResizeX/AutoResizeY flags:
// - May be combined with SetNextWindowSizeConstraints() to set a min/max size for each axis (see "Demo->Child->Auto-resize with Constraints").
// - Size measurement for a given axis is only performed when the child window is within visible boundaries, or is just appearing.
//   - This allows BeginChild() to return false when not within boundaries (e.g. when scrolling), which is more optimal. BUT it won't update its auto-size while clipped.
//     While not perfect, it is a better default behavior as the always-on performance gain is more valuable than the occasional "resizing after becoming visible again" glitch.
//   - You may also use ImGuiChildFlags_AlwaysAutoResize to force an update even when child window is not in view.
//     HOWEVER PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT DOING SO WILL PREVENT BeginChild() FROM EVER RETURNING FALSE, disabling benefits of coarse clipping.

// Flags for ImGui::BeginTable()
// - Important! Sizing policies have complex and subtle side effects, much more so than you would expect.
//   Read comments/demos carefully + experiment with live demos to get acquainted with them.
// - The DEFAULT sizing policies are:
//    - Default to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingFixedFit    if ScrollX is on, or if host window has ImGuiWindowFlags_AlwaysAutoResize.
//    - Default to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingStretchSame if ScrollX is off.
// - When ScrollX is off:
//    - Table defaults to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingStretchSame -> all Columns defaults to ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthStretch with same weight.
//    - Columns sizing policy allowed: Stretch (default), Fixed/Auto.
//    - Fixed Columns (if any) will generally obtain their requested width (unless the table cannot fit them all).
//    - Stretch Columns will share the remaining width according to their respective weight.
//    - Mixed Fixed/Stretch columns is possible but has various side-effects on resizing behaviors.
//      The typical use of mixing sizing policies is: any number of LEADING Fixed columns, followed by one or two TRAILING Stretch columns.
//      (this is because the visible order of columns have subtle but necessary effects on how they react to manual resizing).
// - When ScrollX is on:
//    - Table defaults to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingFixedFit -> all Columns defaults to ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthFixed
//    - Columns sizing policy allowed: Fixed/Auto mostly.
//    - Fixed Columns can be enlarged as needed. Table will show a horizontal scrollbar if needed.
//    - When using auto-resizing (non-resizable) fixed columns, querying the content width to use item right-alignment e.g. SetNextItemWidth(-FLT_MIN) doesn't make sense, would create a feedback loop.
//    - Using Stretch columns OFTEN DOES NOT MAKE SENSE if ScrollX is on, UNLESS you have specified a value for 'inner_width' in BeginTable().
//      If you specify a value for 'inner_width' then effectively the scrolling space is known and Stretch or mixed Fixed/Stretch columns become meaningful again.
// - Read on documentation at the top of imgui_tables.cpp for details.

// Helper: Manually clip large list of items.
// If you have lots evenly spaced items and you have random access to the list, you can perform coarse
// clipping based on visibility to only submit items that are in view.
// The clipper calculates the range of visible items and advance the cursor to compensate for the non-visible items we have skipped.
// (Dear ImGui already clip items based on their bounds but: it needs to first layout the item to do so, and generally
//  fetching/submitting your own data incurs additional cost. Coarse clipping using ImGuiListClipper allows you to easily
//  scale using lists with tens of thousands of items without a problem)
// Usage:
//   ImGuiListClipper clipper;
//   clipper.Begin(1000);         // We have 1000 elements, evenly spaced.
//   while (clipper.Step())
//       for (int i = clipper.DisplayStart; i < clipper.DisplayEnd; i++)
//           ImGui::Text("line number %d", i);
// Generally what happens is:
// - Clipper lets you process the first element (DisplayStart = 0, DisplayEnd = 1) regardless of it being visible or not.
// - User code submit that one element.
// - Clipper can measure the height of the first element
// - Clipper calculate the actual range of elements to display based on the current clipping rectangle, position the cursor before the first visible element.
// - User code submit visible elements.
// - The clipper also handles various subtleties related to keyboard/gamepad navigation, wrapping etc.

// Optional helper to store multi-selection state + apply multi-selection requests.
// - Used by our demos and provided as a convenience to easily implement basic multi-selection.
// - Iterate selection with 'void* it = NULL; ImGuiID id; while (selection.GetNextSelectedItem(&it, &id)) { ... }'
//   Or you can check 'if (Contains(id)) { ... }' for each possible object if their number is not too high to iterate.
// - USING THIS IS NOT MANDATORY. This is only a helper and not a required API.
// To store a multi-selection, in your application you could:
// - Use this helper as a convenience. We use our simple key->value ImGuiStorage as a std::set<ImGuiID> replacement.
// - Use your own external storage: e.g. std::set<MyObjectId>, std::vector<MyObjectId>, interval trees, intrusively stored selection etc.
// In ImGuiSelectionBasicStorage we:
// - always use indices in the multi-selection API (passed to SetNextItemSelectionUserData(), retrieved in ImGuiMultiSelectIO)
// - use the AdapterIndexToStorageId() indirection layer to abstract how persistent selection data is derived from an index.
// - use decently optimized logic to allow queries and insertion of very large selection sets.
// - do not preserve selection order.
// Many combinations are possible depending on how you prefer to store your items and how you prefer to store your selection.
// Large applications are likely to eventually want to get rid of this indirection layer and do their own thing.

FontAtlasFlags :: bit_set[FontAtlasFlag; i32]

// Load and rasterize multiple TTF/OTF fonts into a same texture. The font atlas will build a single texture holding:
//  - One or more fonts.
//  - Custom graphics data needed to render the shapes needed by Dear ImGui.
//  - Mouse cursor shapes for software cursor rendering (unless setting 'Flags |= ImFontAtlasFlags_NoMouseCursors' in the font atlas).
//  - If you don't call any AddFont*** functions, the default font embedded in the code will be loaded for you.
// It is the rendering backend responsibility to upload texture into your graphics API:
//  - ImGui_ImplXXXX_RenderDrawData() functions generally iterate platform_io->Textures[] to create/update/destroy each ImTextureData instance.
//  - Backend then set ImTextureData's TexID and BackendUserData.
//  - Texture id are passed back to you during rendering to identify the texture. Read FAQ entry about ImTextureID/ImTextureRef for more details.
// Legacy path:
//  - Call Build() + GetTexDataAsAlpha8() or GetTexDataAsRGBA32() to build and retrieve pixels data.
//  - Call SetTexID(my_tex_id); and pass the pointer/identifier to your texture in a format natural to your graphics API.
// Common pitfalls:
// - If you pass a 'glyph_ranges' array to AddFont*** functions, you need to make sure that your array persist up until the
//   atlas is build (when calling GetTexData*** or Build()). We only copy the pointer, not the data.
// - Important: By default, AddFontFromMemoryTTF() takes ownership of the data. Even though we are not writing to it, we will free the pointer on destruction.
//   You can set font_cfg->FontDataOwnedByAtlas=false to keep ownership of your data and it won't be freed,
// - Even though many functions are suffixed with "TTF", OTF data is supported just as well.
// - This is an old API and it is currently awkward for those and various other reasons! We will address them in the future!

	// Layout cursor positioning
	// - By "cursor" we mean the current output position.
	// - The typical widget behavior is to output themselves at the current cursor position, then move the cursor one line down.
	// - You can call SameLine() between widgets to undo the last carriage return and output at the right of the preceding widget.
	// - YOU CAN DO 99% OF WHAT YOU NEED WITH ONLY GetCursorScreenPos() and GetContentRegionAvail().
	// - Attention! We currently have inconsistencies between window-local and absolute positions we will aim to fix with future API:
	//    - Absolute coordinate:        GetCursorScreenPos(), SetCursorScreenPos(), all ImDrawList:: functions. -> this is the preferred way forward.
	//    - Window-local coordinates:   SameLine(offset), GetCursorPos(), SetCursorPos(), GetCursorStartPos(), PushTextWrapPos()
	//    - Window-local coordinates:   GetContentRegionMax(), GetWindowContentRegionMin(), GetWindowContentRegionMax() --> all obsoleted. YOU DON'T NEED THEM.

	// ID stack/scopes
	// Read the FAQ (docs/FAQ.md or http://dearimgui.com/faq) for more details about how ID are handled in dear imgui.
	// - Those questions are answered and impacted by understanding of the ID stack system:
	//   - "Q: Why is my widget not reacting when I click on it?"
	//   - "Q: How can I have widgets with an empty label?"
	//   - "Q: How can I have multiple widgets with the same label?"
	// - Short version: ID are hashes of the entire ID stack. If you are creating widgets in a loop you most likely
	//   want to push a unique identifier (e.g. object pointer, loop index) to uniquely differentiate them.
	// - You can also use the "Label##foobar" syntax within widget label to distinguish them from each others.
	// - In this header file we use the "label"/"name" terminology to denote a string that will be displayed + used as an ID,
	//   whereas "str_id" denote a string that is only used as an ID and not normally displayed.

	// Widgets: Drag Sliders
	// - Ctrl+Click on any drag box to turn them into an input box. Manually input values aren't clamped by default and can go off-bounds. Use ImGuiSliderFlags_AlwaysClamp to always clamp.
	// - For all the Float2/Float3/Float4/Int2/Int3/Int4 versions of every function, note that a 'float v[X]' function argument is the same as 'float* v',
	//   the array syntax is just a way to document the number of elements that are expected to be accessible. You can pass address of your first element out of a contiguous set, e.g. &myvector.x
	// - Adjust format string to decorate the value with a prefix, a suffix, or adapt the editing and display precision e.g. "%.3f" -> 1.234; "%5.2f secs" -> 01.23 secs; "Biscuit: %.0f" -> Biscuit: 1; etc.
	// - Format string may also be set to NULL or use the default format ("%f" or "%d").
	// - Speed are per-pixel of mouse movement (v_speed=0.2f: mouse needs to move by 5 pixels to increase value by 1). For keyboard/gamepad navigation, minimum speed is Max(v_speed, minimum_step_at_given_precision).
	// - Use v_min < v_max to clamp edits to given limits. Note that Ctrl+Click manual input can override those limits if ImGuiSliderFlags_AlwaysClamp is not used.
	// - Use v_max = FLT_MAX / INT_MAX etc to avoid clamping to a maximum, same with v_min = -FLT_MAX / INT_MIN to avoid clamping to a minimum.
	// - We use the same sets of flags for DragXXX() and SliderXXX() functions as the features are the same and it makes it easier to swap them.
	// - Legacy: Pre-1.78 there are DragXXX() function signatures that take a final `float power=1.0f' argument instead of the `ImGuiSliderFlags flags=0' argument.

	//  - OpenPopup(): set popup state to open. ImGuiPopupFlags are available for opening options.
	//  - If not modal: they can be closed by clicking anywhere outside them, or by pressing ESCAPE.
	//  - CloseCurrentPopup(): use inside the BeginPopup()/EndPopup() scope to close manually.
	//  - CloseCurrentPopup() is called by default by Selectable()/MenuItem() when activated (FIXME: need some options).
	//  - Use ImGuiPopupFlags_NoOpenOverExistingPopup to avoid opening a popup if there's already one at the same level. This is equivalent to e.g. testing for !IsAnyPopupOpen() prior to OpenPopup().
	//  - Use IsWindowAppearing() after BeginPopup() to tell if a window just opened.
	Gui_OpenPopup            :: proc(str_id: cstring /* = 0 */, popup_flags: GuiPopupFlags /* = 0 */) --- // call to mark popup as open (don't call every frame!).
	Gui_OpenPopupID          :: proc(id: GuiID /* = 0 */, popup_flags: GuiPopupFlags /* = 0 */) --- // id overload to facilitate calling from nested stacks
	Gui_OpenPopupOnItemClick :: proc(str_id: cstring /* = NULL */, popup_flags: GuiPopupFlags /* = 0 */) --- // helper to open popup when clicked on last item. Default to ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonRight == 1. (note: actually triggers on the mouse _released_ event to be consistent with popup behaviors)
	Gui_CloseCurrentPopup    :: proc() --- // manually close the popup we have begin-ed into.

	// Popups: Open+Begin popup combined functions helpers to create context menus.
	//  - Helpers to do OpenPopup+BeginPopup where the Open action is triggered by e.g. hovering an item and right-clicking.
	//  - IMPORTANT: Notice that BeginPopupContextXXX takes ImGuiPopupFlags just like OpenPopup() and unlike BeginPopup(). For full consistency, we may add ImGuiWindowFlags to the BeginPopupContextXXX functions in the future.
	//  - IMPORTANT: If you ever used the left mouse button with BeginPopupContextXXX() helpers before 1.92.6:
	//    - Before this version, OpenPopupOnItemClick(), BeginPopupContextItem(), BeginPopupContextWindow(), BeginPopupContextVoid() had 'a ImGuiPopupFlags popup_flags = 1' default value in their function signature.
	//    - Before: Explicitly passing a literal 0 meant ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonLeft. The default = 1 meant ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonRight.
	//    - After: The default = 0 means ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonRight. Explicitly passing a literal 1 also means ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonRight (if legacy behavior are enabled) or will assert (if legacy behavior are disabled).
	//    - TL;DR: if you don't want to use right mouse button for popups, always specify it explicitly using a named ImGuiPopupFlags_MouseButtonXXXX value.
	//    - Read "API BREAKING CHANGES" 2026/01/07 (1.92.6) entry in imgui.cpp or GitHub topic #9157 for all details.

	// Tables
	// - Full-featured replacement for old Columns API.
	// - See Demo->Tables for demo code. See top of imgui_tables.cpp for general commentary.
	// - See ImGuiTableFlags_ and ImGuiTableColumnFlags_ enums for a description of available flags.
	// The typical call flow is:
	// - 1. Call BeginTable(), early out if returning false.
	// - 2. Optionally call TableSetupColumn() to submit column name/flags/defaults.
	// - 3. Optionally call TableSetupScrollFreeze() to request scroll freezing of columns/rows.
	// - 4. Optionally call TableHeadersRow() to submit a header row. Names are pulled from TableSetupColumn() data.
	// - 5. Populate contents:
	//    - In most situations you can use TableNextRow() + TableSetColumnIndex(N) to start appending into a column.
	//    - If you are using tables as a sort of grid, where every column is holding the same type of contents,
	//      you may prefer using TableNextColumn() instead of TableNextRow() + TableSetColumnIndex().
	//      TableNextColumn() will automatically wrap-around into the next row if needed.
	//    - IMPORTANT: Comparatively to the old Columns() API, we need to call TableNextColumn() for the first column!
	//    - Summary of possible call flow:
	//        - TableNextRow() -> TableSetColumnIndex(0) -> Text("Hello 0") -> TableSetColumnIndex(1) -> Text("Hello 1")  // OK
	//        - TableNextRow() -> TableNextColumn()      -> Text("Hello 0") -> TableNextColumn()      -> Text("Hello 1")  // OK
	//        -                   TableNextColumn()      -> Text("Hello 0") -> TableNextColumn()      -> Text("Hello 1")  // OK: TableNextColumn() automatically gets to next row!
	//        - TableNextRow()                           -> Text("Hello 0")                                               // Not OK! Missing TableSetColumnIndex() or TableNextColumn()! Text will not appear!

	// Tables: Headers & Columns declaration
	// - Use TableSetupColumn() to specify label, resizing policy, default width/weight, id, various other flags etc.
	// - Use TableHeadersRow() to create a header row and automatically submit a TableHeader() for each column.
	//   Headers are required to perform: reordering, sorting, and opening the context menu.
	//   The context menu can also be made available in columns body using ImGuiTableFlags_ContextMenuInBody.
	// - You may manually submit headers using TableNextRow() + TableHeader() calls, but this is only useful in
	//   some advanced use cases (e.g. adding custom widgets in header row).

	// Docking
	// - Read https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking for details.
	// - Enable with io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_DockingEnable.
	// - You can use many Docking facilities without calling any API.
	//   - Drag from window title bar or their tab to dock/undock. Hold SHIFT to disable docking.
	//   - Drag from window menu button (upper-left button) to undock an entire node (all windows).
	//   - When io.ConfigDockingWithShift == true, you instead need to hold SHIFT to enable docking.
	// - DockSpaceOverViewport:
	//   - This is a helper to create an invisible window covering a viewport, then submit a DockSpace() into it.
	//   - Most applications can simply call DockSpaceOverViewport() once to allow docking windows into e.g. the edge of your screen.
	//     e.g. ImGui::NewFrame(); ImGui::DockSpaceOverViewport();                                                   // Create a dockspace in main viewport.
	//      or: ImGui::NewFrame(); ImGui::DockSpaceOverViewport(0, nullptr, ImGuiDockNodeFlags_PassthruCentralNode); // Create a dockspace in main viewport, central node is transparent.
	// - Dockspaces:
	//   - A dockspace is an explicit dock node within an existing window.
	//   - IMPORTANT: Dockspaces need to be submitted _before_ any window they can host. Submit them early in your frame!
	//   - IMPORTANT: Dockspaces need to be kept alive if hidden, otherwise windows docked into it will be undocked.
	//     If you have e.g. multiple tabs with a dockspace inside each tab: submit the non-visible dockspaces with ImGuiDockNodeFlags_KeepAliveOnly.
	//   - See 'Demo->Examples->Dockspace' or 'Demo->Examples->Documents' for more detailed demos.
	// - Programmatic docking:
	//   - There is no public API yet other than the very limited SetNextWindowDockID() function. Sorry for that!
	//   - Read https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking for examples of how to use current internal API.

	// Disabling [BETA API]

	// Inputs Utilities: Raw Keyboard/Mouse/Gamepad Access
	// - Consider using the Shortcut() function instead of IsKeyPressed()/IsKeyChordPressed()! Shortcut() is easier to use and better featured (can do focus routing check).
	// - the ImGuiKey enum contains all possible keyboard, mouse and gamepad inputs (e.g. ImGuiKey_A, ImGuiKey_MouseLeft, ImGuiKey_GamepadDpadUp...).
	// - (legacy: before v1.87 (2022-02), we used ImGuiKey < 512 values to carry native/user indices as defined by each backends. This was obsoleted in 1.87 (2022-02) and completely removed in 1.91.5 (2024-11). See https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/4921)
	Gui_IsKeyDown                       :: proc(key: GuiKey) -> bool ---            // is key being held.

	Gui_GetKeyPressedAmount             :: proc(key: GuiKey, repeat_delay: f32, rate: f32) -> i32 --- // uses provided repeat rate/delay. return a count, most often 0 or 1 but might be >1 if RepeatRate is small enough that DeltaTime > RepeatRate
	Gui_GetKeyName                      :: proc(key: GuiKey) -> cstring ---         // [DEBUG] returns English name of the key. Those names are provided for debugging purpose and are not meant to be saved persistently nor compared.
	Gui_SetNextFrameWantCaptureKeyboard :: proc(want_capture_keyboard: bool) ---    // Override io.WantCaptureKeyboard flag next frame (said flag is left for your application to handle, typically when true it instructs your app to ignore inputs). e.g. force capture keyboard when your widget is being hovered. This is equivalent to setting "io.WantCaptureKeyboard = want_capture_keyboard"; after the next NewFrame() call.

	// Inputs Utilities: Shortcut Testing & Routing
	// - Typical use is e.g.: 'if (ImGui::Shortcut(ImGuiMod_Ctrl | ImGuiKey_S)) { ... }'.
	// - Flags: Default route use ImGuiInputFlags_RouteFocused, but see ImGuiInputFlags_RouteGlobal and other options in ImGuiInputFlags_!
	// - Flags: Use ImGuiInputFlags_Repeat to support repeat.
	// - ImGuiKeyChord = a ImGuiKey + optional ImGuiMod_Alt/ImGuiMod_Ctrl/ImGuiMod_Shift/ImGuiMod_Super.
	//       ImGuiKey_C                          // Accepted by functions taking ImGuiKey or ImGuiKeyChord arguments
	//       ImGuiMod_Ctrl | ImGuiKey_C          // Accepted by functions taking ImGuiKeyChord arguments
	//   only ImGuiMod_XXX values are legal to combine with an ImGuiKey. You CANNOT combine two ImGuiKey values.
	// - The general idea is that several callers may register interest in a shortcut, and only one owner gets it.
	//      Parent   -> call Shortcut(Ctrl+S)    // When Parent is focused, Parent gets the shortcut.
	//        Child1 -> call Shortcut(Ctrl+S)    // When Child1 is focused, Child1 gets the shortcut (Child1 overrides Parent shortcuts)
	//        Child2 -> no call                  // When Child2 is focused, Parent gets the shortcut.
	//   The whole system is order independent, so if Child1 makes its calls before Parent, results will be identical.
	//   This is an important property as it facilitate working with foreign code or larger codebase.
	// - To understand the difference:
	//   - IsKeyChordPressed() compares mods and call IsKeyPressed()
	//     -> the function has no side-effect.
	//   - Shortcut() submits a route, routes are resolved, if it currently can be routed it calls IsKeyChordPressed()
	//     -> the function has (desirable) side-effects as it can prevents another call from getting the route.
	// - Visualize registered routes in 'Metrics/Debugger->Inputs'.

	// Inputs Utilities: Key/Input Ownership [BETA]
	// - One common use case would be to allow your items to disable standard inputs behaviors such
	//   as Tab or Alt key handling, Mouse Wheel scrolling, etc.
	//   e.g. Button(...); SetItemKeyOwner(ImGuiKey_MouseWheelY); to make hovering/activating a button disable wheel for scrolling.
	// - Reminder ImGuiKey enum include access to mouse buttons and gamepad, so key ownership can apply to them.
	// - Many related features are still in imgui_internal.h. For instance, most IsKeyXXX()/IsMouseXXX() functions have an owner-id-aware version.
	Gui_SetItemKeyOwner :: proc(key: GuiKey) --- // Set key owner to last item ID if it is hovered or active. Equivalent to 'if (IsItemHovered() || IsItemActive()) { SetKeyOwner(key, GetItemID());'.

	// Inputs Utilities: Mouse
	// - To refer to a mouse button, you may use named enums in your code e.g. ImGuiMouseButton_Left, ImGuiMouseButton_Right.
	// - You can also use regular integer: it is forever guaranteed that 0=Left, 1=Right, 2=Middle.
	// - Dragging operations are only reported after mouse has moved a certain distance away from the initial clicking position (see 'lock_threshold' and 'io.MouseDraggingThreshold')

	// Advanced: Draw Callbacks
	// - May be used to alter render state (change sampler, blending, current shader). May be used to emit custom rendering commands (difficult to do correctly, but possible).
	// - Use special ImDrawCallback_ResetRenderState callback to instruct backend to reset its render state to the default.
	// - Your rendering loop must check for 'UserCallback' in ImDrawCmd and call the function instead of rendering triangles. All standard backends are honoring this.
	// - For some backends, the callback may access selected render-states exposed by the backend in a ImGui_ImplXXXX_RenderState structure pointed to by platform_io.Renderer_RenderState.
	// - IMPORTANT: please be mindful of the different level of indirection between using size==0 (copying argument) and using size>0 (copying pointed data into a buffer).
	//   - If userdata_size == 0: we copy/store the 'userdata' argument as-is. It will be available unmodified in ImDrawCmd::UserCallbackData during render.
	//   - If userdata_size > 0,  we copy/store 'userdata_size' bytes pointed to by 'userdata'. We store them in a buffer stored inside the drawlist. ImDrawCmd::UserCallbackData will point inside that buffer so you have to retrieve data from there. Your callback may need to use ImDrawCmd::UserCallbackDataSize if you expect dynamically-sized data.
	//   - Support for userdata_size > 0 was added in v1.91.4, October 2024. So earlier code always only allowed to copy/store a simple void*.
